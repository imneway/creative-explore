description: Iterative creative exploration for generating brand-compliant marketing and operational images using AI. Use this skill whenever the user wants to create KV designs, marketing visuals, operational graphics, event posters, or any brand-compliant image assets. Also trigger when the user provides brand rules together with image generation needs, mentions "creative exploration", asks to iterate on generated visuals, or wants to brainstorm visual directions for a campaign. Works with any brand that has a rules document.

# Creative Exploration

Generate brand-compliant marketing and operational images through iterative creative exploration.

## Conversation Style

Be concise, friendly, and professional. Don't over-explain. Guide the user forward with short, clear questions at natural decision points: "Which directions do you want to take further?" / "Want to try with reference images this time?"

## Setup

On the first use in a session:

1. **Workspace path** — Ask: "Is the current directory your project workspace? If not, please tell me the path."
2. **Brand rules** — Look for a brand rules markdown file (e.g. `*-Brand-Rules.md`). Read it thoroughly — colors, typography, visual language, constraints, and any AI prompt guidelines.
3. **Brand assets** — Scan the `assets/` directory. Read each image to understand what's available (patterns, icons, logos, illustrations). Build a mental inventory — you'll use these automatically later.
4. **Brand colors** — Extract the primary brand colors from the rules for use in the HTML preview.
5. **Task requirements** — Ask the user for the brief. Also let them know: "You can also share a task requirements doc (Feishu/Lark URL works), reference images, or any style notes."

If the user provides a Feishu/Lark wiki URL, extract `document_id` from `larksuite.com/wiki/{document_id}` and read with `mcp__claude_ai_Feishu__read_document_content`.

## Workflow

### Round 1: Divergent Exploration

The first round is about **breadth and inspiration**.

1. **Brainstorm 5+ creative directions** as text. Each needs:
   - A short bilingual name (e.g. "Tessellation Wave (镶嵌波)")
   - A 1-2 sentence concept description
   - How it connects to the brief's keywords

   Push beyond the obvious. Consider metaphors, abstract interpretations, cultural references, unexpected visual approaches.

2. **Auto-attach brand assets**: Based on the brief and the brand assets you inventoried, select the most relevant assets (patterns, textures, icons) and automatically use them as style references via edit mode. No need to ask — if the workspace has brand assets that match the visual language described in the brand rules, use them by default.

3. **Generate quick drafts** using `nano-banana-2` for speed. One image per direction.

4. **Present in HTML preview** and open in browser.

5. **Archive** the round.

6. Ask: "Which directions do you want to explore further? Or want me to try new ones?"

### Subsequent Rounds: Converge or Diverge

Based on user feedback:

- **Diverge further**: New directions, variations, or mashups of what worked
- **Converge**: Focus on selected directions, refine prompts. Suggest upgrading model for quality — "These directions look solid. Want to try GPT Image or Nano Banana Pro for higher quality?"

## Model Registry

When the user mentions a model by casual name, map it to the correct fal.ai model ID:

| User says | Model ID | Size values | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| "nano banana", "nb2", "fast" | `fal-ai/nano-banana-2` | `landscape_4_3`, `square`, `portrait_4_3` | Default for Round 1 (fast, cheap) |
| "nano banana pro", "nb pro", "pro" | `fal-ai/nano-banana-pro` | `landscape_4_3`, `square`, `portrait_4_3` | Higher fidelity |
| "gpt", "gpt image", "openai" | `fal-ai/gpt-image-1.5` | `1536x1024`, `1024x1024`, `1024x1536` | Best detail/composition |
| "edit", "with reference" | `fal-ai/nano-banana-2/edit` | `aspect_ratio`: "16:9", "4:3", "1:1" | Style/element reference mode |

If a new model version exists (e.g. user says "latest gpt"), use `search-models.sh` to look it up:
```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/fal-generate/scripts/search-models.sh --category "text-to-image"
```

## Reference Image Handling

Users may provide one or more reference images. Each image can serve a different purpose — don't assume they're all style references.

### Determine reference intent

If the user doesn't specify how to use their reference images, make a smart judgment based on the image content:

- **Brand pattern / texture / abstract graphic** → Style reference (color palette, visual language)
- **Photo / scene / composition** → Composition or mood reference
- **Logo / mascot / specific object** → Element to embed in the composition
- **Another design / poster** → Layout and style reference

If ambiguous, ask briefly: "Image A looks like a style reference, image B is a mascot — should I use A for style and embed B into the composition?"

### Prompt patterns for each reference type

**Style reference** — extract visual language, don't reproduce:
```
Use the attached image ONLY as style reference for [color palette / geometric language / texture style]. Do NOT reproduce it. Create a new original composition: [prompt]
```

**Element / object to embed** — incorporate the specific object:
```
The attached image contains a [mascot / logo / product]. Incorporate this [element] prominently into the composition: [prompt]
```

**Composition / layout reference** — follow structure:
```
Use the attached image as a layout reference. Follow its general composition and spatial arrangement, but create original visuals in the brand style: [prompt]
```

**Mixed references** — when multiple images serve different roles, describe each:
```
Image 1 is a style reference for color palette and triangular geometric language — extract the style but do NOT copy it. Image 2 contains a mascot character — embed it into the scene. Create a new composition: [prompt]
```

### Technical rules for edit mode

- **Sync only**: Use `fal.run`, never `queue.fal.run` — queue returns HTTP 405 for edit endpoints
- **Set aspect_ratio explicitly**: Default is 1:1, always specify (e.g. "16:9", "4:3")
- Upload local files first with `upload.sh`, cache CDN URLs for the session

```bash
# Upload
bash ~/.claude/skills/fal-generate/scripts/upload.sh --file "/path/to/image.png"

# Generate with references
curl -s -X POST "https://fal.run/fal-ai/nano-banana-2/edit" \
  -H "Authorization: Key $FAL_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "[reference instructions + actual prompt]",
    "image_urls": ["https://...ref1.png", "https://...ref2.png"],
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "resolution": "1K",
    "num_images": 1
  }'
```

## Text-to-Image (no references)

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/fal-generate/scripts/generate.sh \
  --prompt "..." \
  --model "fal-ai/nano-banana-2" \
  --size landscape
```

## FAL_KEY Setup

`$FAL_KEY` should be set in the user's shell profile. If missing, guide:
```
You need a fal.ai API key:
1. Sign up at https://fal.ai
2. Add to ~/.zshrc: export FAL_KEY="your_key_here"
3. Run: source ~/.zshrc
```

## HTML Preview

After generating images, create an HTML preview page at `/tmp/creative-explore/round{N}.html`.

### Styling rules

- **Default**: Clean neutral gray (`#f5f5f5` background, `#333` text, `#666` accents) — no brand colors unless detected
- **With brand**: If brand rules define primary/accent colors, use them for direction titles, labels, and accent elements. Extract during setup and apply throughout
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">` — always required
- Include Figma capture script: `<script src="https://mcp.figma.com/mcp/html-to-design/capture.js" async></script>`

### Card layout for each direction

Each direction card must include:
1. **Generated image** (full width)
2. **Model name** label
3. **Input/reference images** as thumbnails (height ~60px) above or beside the prompt box — so the user can see what was fed into the model and easily copy these URLs to try on other platforms
4. **Full prompt** in a monospace box — the user needs this to iterate

### Serve locally

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/creative-explore
cd /tmp/creative-explore && python3 -m http.server 8899 &
open "http://localhost:8899/round{N}.html"
```

See `references/html-template.md` for the base template.

## Archive

After each round, save to the workspace:

```
{workspace}/{brand or project name}/{yyyy-mm-dd}-{task title}/round{N}/
```

Download images from fal CDN with `curl -o` and copy the HTML preview file.

## Prompt Writing Patterns

Adapt to the brand's visual language (read the brand rules first):

- **Context first**: "Abstract [concept] for a [context], [background description]"
- **Brand colors by hex**: Models respond well to specific hex codes
- **Constraints at the end**: "No text, no logos, no people. [mood adjectives]."
- **Layout**: "Left side with generous whitespace for text placement"
- **Bilingual names**: Help multilingual teams — "Gateway (门户)", "Constellation (星座)"

Common pitfalls:
- Not using available brand assets as references — always check the assets directory first
- Forgetting to specify background lightness — many models default to dark
- Over-describing — shorter, focused prompts often work better
